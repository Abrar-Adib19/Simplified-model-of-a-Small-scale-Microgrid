What is a Microgrid? It is a small-sized power supply network that is designed to provide power for a small community. It enables local power generation for local loads. Microgrids can incorporate battery systems to store electricity and deploy it during outages or when grid demand spikes. It is connected to both the local generating units and the utility grid thus preventing power outages. In this work, the performance of a small-scale mirogrid was analyzed throughout a 24 hour cycle. By observing the simulation result, we came to a conclusion that if we upgrade the energy storage system ( battery) with the help  of super capacitor, the load  graph will be flattened.
